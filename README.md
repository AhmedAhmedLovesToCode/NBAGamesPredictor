# NBAGamesPredictor
I worked on a project where I predicted the outcomes of future NBA games using Python and machine learning. I gathered and processed historical NBA game data, applied various machine learning models, and evaluated their performance to identify the best approach for predictions. Using Jupyter Lab as my development environment, I conducted data exploration, feature engineering, and model training, while leveraging its powerful visualization tools to analyze trends and results. This project deepened my understanding of both sports analytics and predictive modeling techniques.
